KNX client connectivity in Common Lisp

## What is KNX?

KNX is an industry standard fieldbus system used for facility/building automation. It is the successor of EIB (European Installation Bus). Read more here: [KNX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KNX).

While not necessarily meant for private, one-family homes, some use it also there.  
There are currently quite a few home-automation solutions out there which comes with support for KNX. Some of them are: [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/) (Java based), [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) (Python based).

KNX installations usually use a two-wire twisted pair cable (TP). But there is support for ethernet (IP) via gateways/routers and tunnelling. This is often used to connect buildings over longer distances into one KNX installation.

The KNXnet/IP gateways are also utilized by the home-automation solutions mentioned above, by listening on changes on the bus and also send change requests to devices or range of devices via so called group-addresses.

KNXnet/IP is supported by a variety of languages and runtimes. Among others: Java, Python, C, Elixir, Perl, ...

This project provides KNXnet/IP support for Common Lisp.
